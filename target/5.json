Be concise!**\nI want to suggest that ya'll add interior remodeling to houses for a cost similar to that of previous custom houses. \n‎\n**Why do you Suggestion this?**\nI am suggesting this because some houses are dated or have designs that the people who own the houses don't find desirable. If you guys implemented this it would let people really make their premium houses their own and would provide something for the older players to spend their money on as well as being another way to help take money out of the economy.",
