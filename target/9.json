Be concise!**\nI want to suggest that ya'll add interior remodeling to houses for a similar price to that of prior custom houses.\n‎\n**Why do you Suggestion this?**\nI am suggesting this because some of the house designs are dated or are undesirable by the premium house owners. If you implemented this it would allow players to really make their houses their own as well as give something for the players with tons of money to do. This would take money out of the economy and would also be easier to do compared to custom houses.",
